## Overview

This portfolio features an interactive winter diorama created in Blender, selecting the focal object (arcade machine) reveals my UI by utilising React and JavaScript. A custom loading screen is used to hide the main scene while objects load. The responsive UI was built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, aiming to cover all viewport sizes.
